The story of this young, intelligent country boy wound up as the leader of the most populous nation on Earth was astonishing.
It was not unlike Steve Job's biography by Isaacson, in that Jobs and Mao both had their merits, but used a great deal more of luck to get into the dictatorial positions they occupied. 
While I lost respect for Jobs after reading his biogaphy, I grew to respect Mao a moderate amount. 
He certainly had merits as a military strategist and enough academic chops to be dangerous. 
However he was clearly no great human being after which anyone should model their life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most valuable part of the book was getting inside the mind of someone who was so influential in a part of the world where I have very limited experience.
When I now  hear news about China I digest it in a different, more involved manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Michael Sizemore</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 -0000</pubDate><guid>tag:,2013-01-01:mao-a-biography-by-ross-terrill.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
