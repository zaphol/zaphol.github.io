quickly. How are you gonna go pro?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most first-time players find that when they throw a backhand and a forehand, the forehand generates much more spin. What they actually see is that their forehand throw goes straight for much longer than their backhand throw. This isn't inherently a bad occurrance. But since it's my blog I can say that a backhand throw allows for a greater variety of shots with more sensitivity and accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it easier to generate spin with a forehand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get an extra source of spin, that's why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few points in a player's throwing form that generate spin. Let's review:
1. Waist
2. Wrist
3. Fingers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When throwing a forehand the fingers action is similar if not identical to throwing a baseball. The fingers start from an open-palm position and contract toward a closed fist position. That's the same muscle contraction used to grasp an object, a motion we've been practicing since birth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a backhand throw the fingers move in the opposite direction. They start in a closed-fist and relax towards an open-palm position. There are not many situations in life that call for a strong finger muscle relaxation. Perhaps if you throw a bowling ball with your fingers in the hole and try to maximize your backspin you could come close. But the point of this story is that the finger motion used in backhand throws is much less common than the motion required for a forehand throw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people throw backhand all the time and it works out just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, sure it works out fine. Your wrist and armspeed are enough to throw "just fine" but if you want to throw with smooth controlled and effortless power you need to incorporate the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I really have a problem with this. Everyone says my form looks smooth and I can throw a reasonable distance for my level of experience. How do I know if I have a problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you throw for distance what does it sound like? When I first started learning to play in 2008 everybody wanted great snap on their drive. Literally, they wanted to hear a loud snap. The louder the sound, the more powerful the throw must be. The pros even said "the disc should rip out of your hands." But when Dave Feldberg and Ken Climo gave a clinic at Collegiate Nationals in 2011 Dave emphasized the silent disc throw. Instead of 'SNAP' the most you should hear is a short 'pffft,' just the sound of the disc through the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's happening when I 'SNAP' a drive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snap is created by the disc ripping out of the hand and the fingers snapping back into the palm. That means the fingers were gripping the disc extremely tightly (a good thing!) but they didn't contribute much to the throw. All their force was perpindicular to the flight plate. When a powerful drive is silent, those fingers are converting the force of the grip into a spinning force that is parallel to the flight plate, coplanar to the flight of the disc. In a silent throw each of the fingers is contributing spin to the disc. The difference between using your fingers and not using them is as stark as the difference between my drive and Devin Frederick's drive. I recently played on a double team with Devin at a local league night and I couldn't help but notice his drive. It was slow, smooth and silent. Even when throwing for power it seemed he never put more than 60% power into a throw. The course we played had multiple holes over 400 feet so I had plenty of opportunities to watch him work. On every long drive I pulled back as if to start a lawn mower nad pulled through my shot with 90% power and a loud snap. The result was a disc that faded out after 350 feet at best. When Devin threw the same shot he didn't contort his body or turn his shoulders 180 degrees on his reach back. He simply started slowly and built up to a smooth acceleration that ended in a silent throw. It was the difference between throwing a disc and releasing a disc. Devin was intentionally applying spin to his disc whereas I was simply ramping up my armspeed and letting go. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Michael Sizemore</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0000</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.discgolfnet.org,2013-06-13:the-secret-to-backhand.html</guid><category>disc golf</category></item></channel></rss>
